**Session 13: November 23, 2024 – Natural Language Processing (NLP) Fundamentals: Teaching Machines to Read and Write**

**Part 1: The Language of Machines: An Introduction to NLP**

* **What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?**
    * **The Art of Conversation with Machines:** NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. It's about bridging the gap between the way humans communicate and the way machines process information.

    * **Applications of NLP:** NLP powers a wide array of applications that you interact with daily:
        * **Virtual Assistants:** Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use NLP to understand your voice commands and respond in natural language.
        * **Machine Translation:**  Services like Google Translate rely on NLP to translate text from one language to another.
        * **Sentiment Analysis:**  NLP helps companies analyze customer reviews and social media posts to gauge public sentiment about their products or services.
        * **Chatbots:** NLP-powered chatbots provide customer support, answer questions, and automate conversations.
        * **Text Summarization:**  NLP can condense lengthy articles or documents into concise summaries.


* **The NLP Pipeline:**
    * **Text Preprocessing:**
        * **Tokenization:**  Breaking down text into smaller units like words or subwords.
        * **Lowercasing:** Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
        * **Stop Word Removal:**  Filtering out common words like "the," "and," "is" that don't carry much meaning.
        * **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

    * **Feature Extraction:**
        * **Word Embeddings:** Representing words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between words. Popular models include Word2Vec and GloVe.
        * **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** A numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.

    * **Modeling:** Applying machine learning algorithms to the preprocessed text and features to perform tasks like classification, sentiment analysis, or language generation.

**Part 2: Practical Exercise: Text Classification with Pre-trained Models**

* **Task:** Build a text classifier to categorize movie reviews as positive or negative.
* **Tool:** Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models.
* **Model:** We'll use a pre-trained DistilBERT model, which is a smaller and faster version of the BERT model, well-suited for text classification.

**Steps:**

1. **Install the Library:**  `pip install transformers`
2. **Load the Model and Tokenizer:** Download and load the DistilBERT model and tokenizer.
3. **Prepare the Dataset:** Get a dataset of movie reviews with sentiment labels (positive/negative).
4. **Tokenize and Encode:** Convert the text into numerical representations that the model can understand.
5. **Train or Fine-tune the Model:** If you have a large dataset, you can fine-tune the pre-trained model on your data. Otherwise, you can train a classifier on top of the model's outputs.
6. **Evaluate the Model:** Assess the model's accuracy and other metrics on a test set.

**Example Code (Conceptual):**

```python
from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertForSequenceClassification
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load model and tokenizer
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")

# Load dataset (example)
dataset = load_dataset("sst2")

# Preprocess and tokenize
...

# Train or fine-tune
...

# Evaluate
...
```
